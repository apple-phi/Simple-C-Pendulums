# Simple-C-Pendulums
A practice project I did for learning SDL2 with C. You need SDL2 installed to compile this project (`brew install sdl2` for OSX).

This is a pendulum simulation based off a [demo by Sebastian Lague](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGk0rnyTa1U)
and the [Coding Math explanations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HjO_RGIjCU) for Verlet integration.

Execute `./build.sh` to build the project.

## Commands
| Action| Function                |
|-------|-------------------------|
| Mouse | Draws sticks and points |
| Space | Starts/stops simulation |
|   r   | Resets simulation       |
